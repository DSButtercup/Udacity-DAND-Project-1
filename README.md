# Investigate A Dataset: Fertility Rate and Female Employment

The aim of this project was to investigate the relationships and trends between the number of children per woman in a given country, and the female employment rates in that country, for 3 employment sectors (agriculture, industry, service) and 2 employment statuses (self-employed workers, family workers), across nearly 200 countries.

## DATA GATHERING
I obtained data provided by the United Nations on birth rates, and data provided by the International Labour Organisation on female employment rates. I had 7 CSV files in total.

## DATA WRANGLING AND FEATURE SELECTION
I assessed and cleaned the individual datasets, addressing missing values, data consistency, and data accuracy. I then selected the relevant features from each dataset and combined them to form a new dataset.

## DATA ANALYSIS
I drew up 5 research questions to address using the data. I then analyzed the data, making use of descriptive statistics such as the means, medians, correlation and skewness. I also generated data visualizations, including histograms, scatter plot matrices, line plots, and heatmaps.

## FINDINGS
I presented the following insights from my exploration and analysis:
- The average employment rate was higher for countries with higher fertility rates than for those with low fertility rates.
- Countries with higher fertility rate had higher employment rate in the agriculture sector and lower employment rate in the service sector.
- For countries with higher fertility rates, it was more likely for female workers to be self-employed workers than family workers. For lower fertility rates, employment rate was similar for all workers.
- Fertility rate varied more closely with employment sector than with employment status.
- Countries with higher employment rate in agriculture had higher employment rate of family workers and self-employed workers, and lower employment rate in the service sector.
